# welcome to OTP project work '_' /
i have made a operational code for the billing sysytem in which computer by default ask for the anonymous numeric code to complete the transcation which will prevent the daily scams and cyber attacks to users which may get caught into the trap of hackers .
my code runs on a cloth store organisation which is mostly like a self checkout system .
the user will choose the items from the store inventory and add that into the cart .
In the payment window if the payment exceeds $50 in total it will atuomaticaly allow the user to put the code else the transcation block will be ended .
if the payment is less then $50 then it will continue and will allow the user to checkout and have a printed receipt .
